<h2>Virat Kohli</h2>
<p>Virat Kohli, born on November 5, 1988, is an Indian international cricketer widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of the sport. His journey began in Delhi, where his passion for the game was nurtured from a young age. He rose through the ranks of domestic cricket, captaining the India Under-19 team to a World Cup victory in 2008, a moment that catapulted him into the national spotlight.
His senior international debut for India came later that year. Initially seen as a brash and aggressive youngster, Kohli channeled his intensity into his batting, becoming a prolific run-scorer. He was part of the Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup, and his career took off from there. His ability to chase down daunting totals in One Day Internationals (ODIs) earned him the nickname "King Kohli" and established him as one of the most effective chasers in cricket history.
Kohli's dominance extended to all three formats of the game. He holds numerous records, including the most centuries in ODI matches, a record he surpassed from his idol, Sachin Tendulkar. He is the only Indian cricketer to have held the number one spot in the ICC rankings for all three formats (Test, ODI, and T20I). His leadership skills were also recognized when he was appointed captain of the Indian team, leading them to historic victories, including India's first-ever Test series win in Australia in 2018-19.
A fitness enthusiast, Kohli is known for his strict training regime and disciplined lifestyle, which has set new benchmarks for physical fitness in Indian cricket. Off the field, he is a prominent public figure, married to Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma, and is involved in various commercial and philanthropic endeavors. After an illustrious career, which included being a key member of the victorious 2024 ICC T20 World Cup squad, he announced his retirement from T20 internationals. He also recently retired from Test cricket, leaving behind an indelible legacy as a fearless leader and a masterful batsman.
His journey from a young boy with a dream to a global cricketing icon is a testament to his hard work, perseverance, and unwavering passion for the game. Kohli's impact on cricket goes beyond statistics; he redefined the standards of fitness, aggression, and performance, inspiring a new generation of cricketers and fans worldwide.</p> <br>
